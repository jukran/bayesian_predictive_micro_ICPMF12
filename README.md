## Workshop_(inactivation).ipynb / Workshop_(growth).ipynb

This code is a Python notebook for a workshop on Bayesian modeling of bacterial inactivation/growth.<br>
It includes several sections, such as:<br>

<ul>
<li>Loading required libraries
<li>Reading and preparing data from a CSV file
<li>Constructing a model using Stan, which includes data, parameters, and a model section
<li>Sampling the MCMC posterior distribution using NUTS algorithm
<li>Visualizing the trace of parameters using arviz
<li>Fitting the data using frequentist method and plotting the results
<li>Predicting the cell count at a given time using the Bayesian model and plotting the results
</ul>
