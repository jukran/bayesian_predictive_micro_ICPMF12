It includes several sections, such as:<br>

<ul>
<li>Constructing a model using Stan, which includes data, parameters, and a model section
<li>Sampling the MCMC posterior distribution using NUTS algorithm
<li>Fitting the data using frequentist method and plotting the results
<li>Predicting the cell count at a given time using the Bayesian model and plotting the results
</ul>
